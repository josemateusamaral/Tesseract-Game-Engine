  Tesseract Game Engine is a software rendering game engine that intends to provide an easy way to render large scenes using just the CPU. It is fully made using C++ and SDL2, so it can run pretty much everywhere.
  The engine is in its beginning state, so it will take some time to be really useful. I intend to add things like physics support, shader support, sound support, Nanite, and so on.
  The engine was born in the course of computer science at the Intituto Intituto Federal Catarinense on the campus of Blumenau. It was initially intended to be an assessment method for object-oriented programming.
